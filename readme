This is a collection of XML and XSL files and a shell script for generating 
a webpage with module dependency graphs.

--------------------------------------

The following are the XML source files:

- modules.xml
  + an XML tree of all modules and their prerequisites

- pathways.xml
  + an XML tree which specifies which modules are to be included in which pathway

The following are XSL transforms:

- pax2mox.xsl
  + operates on the tree pathway.xml
  + generates a collection of subtrees of modules.xml, one for each pathway
  + each subtree includes the modules specified in the pathway, together with
    their prerequisites.
  + also outputs a webpage pathways.html which will contain all the diagrams
  
- mox2dot.xsl
  + converts an XML tree of modules to a graphviz DOT file
  + you can convert a DOT file to an SVG image via the command
    $ dot -Tsvg filename -O

The following is a shell script:

- pipeline.sh
  + runs the XSLT transforms in the required order and then outputs the webpage
    pathways.htm.

--------------------------------------

To make all this work, you will need
- an XSLT2.0 parser (like Saxon B, http://saxon.sourceforge.net/)
- graphviz (https://www.graphviz.org/)

The easy way to run the program is to modify the files modules.xml and
pathways.xml to suit your needs, then run pipeline.sh. This will generate
all the files you need which you can then upload to your website. These files
are: pathways.htm and pathway-*.svg

If you can't run a shell script, for whatever reason, then follow these
instructions instead:

1. First, use your XSLT parser to apply pax2mox.xsl to pathways.xml

   $ saxonb-xslt -s:pathways.xml -xsl:pax2mox.xsl -o:emptyfile -ext:on

2. Now, for each pathway (e.g. "algebra") in your pathway file, use
   your XSLT parser to convert the newly created subtree
   (pathway-algebra.xml) into a DOT file; then convert the DOT file
   into an image using graphviz:

   $ saxonb-xslt -s:pathway-algebra.xml -xsl:mox2dot.xsl -o:pathway-algebra
   $ dot -Tsvg "pathway-algebra" -O
